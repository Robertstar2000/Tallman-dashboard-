# Tallman Dashboard User Guide

Welcome to the Tallman Leadership Dashboard. This guide will help you understand and utilize the features available to you.

## Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard provides a real-time overview of key business metrics for Tallman Equipment. It is divided into two main sections:

1.  **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: The column on the left displays the most critical, high-level metrics for at-a-glance monitoring. These include total orders, daily revenue, open invoices, and more.
2.  **Detailed Charts**: The main grid area contains interactive charts that break down data into more specific categories like Accounts, Customer Metrics, Inventory, and Site Distribution.

### Understanding the Data

-   **KPI Cards**: Each card shows a specific metric. The color indicates the category. The value is updated periodically. If a card shows "OFFLINE", it means the data could not be retrieved from the source system at that time.
-   **Charts**: Hover over the bars, lines, or pie slices in the charts to see detailed figures for that data point. You can also use the legend to understand what each color or line represents.

## Operating Modes

The dashboard can run in two modes, which an administrator can switch between from the Admin page:

-   **Demo Mode**: In this mode, the dashboard uses AI to generate realistic, simulated data. You will see the numbers on the KPIs and charts update frequently (e.g., every 15 seconds that the data worker is running) as the AI generates new values. This is useful for demonstration and for seeing how the dashboard functions without affecting live data.
-   **Production Mode**: This mode attempts to connect to the company's live database systems. The data is real but may update less frequently. If a connection to a database fails, you may see "OFFLINE" values for the affected metrics.

## Interacting with the Dashboard

-   **Navigation**: If you have administrative privileges, you will see an "Admin" button in the header, which takes you to the administration panel.
-   **Theme**: The dashboard supports both light and dark themes for your viewing comfort. An administrator can toggle the theme via the global application settings.

If you have any questions or notice any issues, please contact your system administrator.
